## üéØ Objective

Learn how to deploy your very first application on Kubernetes!  
We‚Äôll use a simple NGINX web server as an example and walk through every step ‚Äî from creating the file, to running commands, to checking if it worked.

## üìù Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Make the Pod Definition File (`pod.yaml`)

Everything in Kubernetes uses a YAML file. Here‚Äôs one that tells Kubernetes to run an NGINX server for us.

Copy this into a new file named `pod.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
````

---

### 2. Deploy the Pod

Now we tell Kubernetes to create this pod using the command line.

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

If it works, you should see something like this:

```
pod/nginx-pod created
```

---

### 3. Check If the Pod is Running

Let‚Äôs make sure our pod is up and running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

For more details (like which node it's on):

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

---

### 4. See the Logs

Let‚Äôs check the logs to make sure the NGINX server is starting correctly:

```bash
kubectl logs nginx-pod
```

---

### 5. Get More Info (For Troubleshooting)

If something doesn‚Äôt work, this command gives you a lot of helpful info:

```bash
kubectl describe pod nginx-pod
```
