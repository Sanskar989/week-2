## üéØ Objective (Class Assingment)

Learn how to deploy your very first application on Kubernetes!  
We‚Äôll use a simple NGINX web server as an example and walk through every step ‚Äî from creating the file, to running commands, to checking if it worked.

## üó∫Ô∏è Diagram: How It Works

## üìù Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Make the Pod Definition File (`pod.yaml`)

Everything in Kubernetes uses a YAML file. Here‚Äôs one that tells Kubernetes to run an NGINX server for us.

Copy this into a new file named `pod.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
````

---

### 2. Deploy the Pod

Now we tell Kubernetes to create this pod using the command line.

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

If it works, you should see something like this:

```
pod/nginx-pod created
```

---

### 3. Check If the Pod is Running

Let‚Äôs make sure our pod is up and running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

For more details (like which node it's on):

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

---

### 4. See the Logs

Let‚Äôs check the logs to make sure the NGINX server is starting correctly:

```bash
kubectl logs nginx-pod
```

---

### 5. Get More Info (For Troubleshooting)

If something doesn‚Äôt work, this command gives you a lot of helpful info:

```bash
kubectl describe pod nginx-pod
```

# MongoDB + Mongo-Express on Kubernetes(TAKE HOME ASSINGMENT)

---

## üéØ Objective

Deploy a secure, real-world, multi-tier application on Kubernetes using best practices for secrets and configuration.
This project sets up a MongoDB database and a Mongo-Express web interface, all managed by Kubernetes.

## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture & Workflow


![ChatGPT Image Jun 23, 2025, 10_10_29 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/785ac2e0-5679-4ae9-b572-de63fd680d71)


**Workflow:**
User ‚Üí (LoadBalancer Service) ‚Üí Mongo-Express Pod ‚Üí (Internal Service) ‚Üí MongoDB Pod (with Secrets/ConfigMaps for credentials and configs)

---

## üìù Deployment Steps

### 1. **Create and Apply Kubernetes Secret**

* Encode your database username and password in base64 and create a Kubernetes Secret manifest for them.
* Apply the secret to your cluster.
![Screenshot 2025-06-22 010958](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9985d1d-93e8-4ad7-85ba-f4d49adf2086)

### 2. **Deploy MongoDB with Internal Service**

* Write a Deployment for MongoDB and a Service to give it a stable internal address.
* Reference the secret for MongoDB credentials in the deployment.

### 3. **Create a ConfigMap for App Config**

* Make a ConfigMap for the Mongo-Express app to know the database‚Äôs internal service name.
* Apply the ConfigMap.

### 4. **Deploy Mongo-Express with External Service**

* Write a Deployment for Mongo-Express, referencing both the ConfigMap and Secret for configuration and credentials.
* Expose Mongo-Express with a Service of type LoadBalancer (or NodePort for Minikube).

### 5. **Access and Test**

* Use your cluster‚Äôs service management (like `minikube service mongo-express-service`) to get the external URL.
* Login to Mongo-Express in your browser with the credentials you created and confirm that it connects to MongoDB.

### 6. **Cleanup**

* Delete all deployments, services, secrets, and configmaps you created for this assignment.
